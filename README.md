# Computer Science Resource Center
This resource center was initially meant to enhance the communication between the computer science teacher and students at [Gaudium et Studium](https://www.liceum.eduges.pl). However, it has become a general platform that gathers useful resources for studying [Computer Science in IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/sciences/computer-science/).

## How to use
The website is divided into four sections:
- General information: here you'll find the latest news concerning CS IBDP course as well as grade boundaries
- Resources: by far the most useful for newcomers who can find different types of resources fro CS IBDP course
- Internal Assessemnt: deadlines for GES school and grade boundaries
- External Assessment: detailed description of external components of CS IBDP course

## Tools
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - a well-known static website generator (for version requirements see the [Requirements](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book#requirements) sections of the theme)
- [Hugo Book Theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) - a simple plain book theme

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute, just fork this repository, make some changes, and open pull request.
Any contributions are welcomed!

However, if you need some help with contributing (for instance, you're a beginner), I wrote an article explaining step-by-step how to do so. You can find it on [IBlieve blog](https://iblieve.org/elevating-ib-computer-science-a-resource-center-guide/). The article assumes you have some basic knowledge about git, Github, and VSCode, but if you don't (which I highly doubt since you're reading this), I also wrote two supplementary articles on my [personal blog](https://undemalum.github.io/portfolio/about/) for you to catch up ([here](https://undemalum.github.io/portfolio/posts/resource-center-environment-preparation/) and [here](https://undemalum.github.io/portfolio/posts/resource-center-publishing-changes/)).
