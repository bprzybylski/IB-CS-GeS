| - | - | - | - | - |
| - Topic<br>- Research question<br>- Methodology | - Context<br>- Subject-specific terminology and concepts |  - Research<br>- Analysis<br>- Discussion and evaluation | - Structure<br>- Layout | - Process<br>- Research focus |
| Marks | Marks | Marks | Marks | Marks |
| 6 | 6 | 12 | 4 | 6|

## Criterion A: Focus and method
**Strands**: `Topic`, `Research question`, `Methodology`

- **Clear Title Focus:**
  - Title should prominently feature the computer science aspect of the research.

- **Avoid ITGS, Broad, and Futuristic Topics:**
  - Ensure your topic aligns with computer science rather than leaning towards social aspects suited for ITGS. 
  - Be cautious of selecting overly broad topics that may lead to a superficial treatment within the word limit.
  - Steer clear of speculative or futuristic topics that often result in opinion-based essays lacking substantial factual support.

- **Sharp and Accessible Research Question:**
  - Ensure a well-focused research question that allows for in-depth exploration within the 4,000-word limit and is suitable for an IB student's understanding. 
  - *Clearly state the research question as a question in the introduction*, providing context for the areas investigated.

- **Justification for Topic:**
  - Explain why the chosen topic and research question are suitable and significant for an Extended Essay. Provide sufficient background information related to the chosen topic.

- **Transparent Methodology:**
  - Clearly describe the methodology to be employed in answering the research question. 
  - Consider incorporating experimental or programming elements with valuable data sources, avoiding reliance on small-scale surveys from fellow students.

- **Well-Planned Essay:**
  - Ensure a well-structured and planned essay that draws from authoritative sources, including internet, literature, and expert interviews.


## Criterion B: Knowledge and understanding
**Strands**: `Context`, `Subject-specific terminology and concepts`

- **Demonstrate Personal Understanding:**
  - Showcase your comprehension of the chosen topic, avoiding reliance on reworded source material.
  - Provide clarifications or simplified explanations of technical information, always linking it back to the original research question.

- **Strategic Use of Source Material:**
  - Select and incorporate source material to illustrate the knowledge you gained in relation to the chosen topic.

- **Technical Language Appropriateness:**
  - Employ a technical language suitable for computer science, ensuring clarity that reflects the student's understanding.
  - *Avoid excessive technicality, considering that the reader may not be an expert in the specific addressed topic*.

## Criterion C: Critical thinking
**Strands**: `Research`, `Analysis` and `Discussion and evaluation`

- **Logical Argument Development:**
  - Develop a logically flowing argument throughout the essay.

- **Selective and Critical Use of Information:**
  - *Select information directly relevant to the research question*, avoiding an excessive number of sources.
  - Evaluate the relevance, necessity, and validity of sources.

- **Thorough Analysis and Conclusions:**
  - Draw conclusions throughout the essay, not solely in the concluding section.
  - Analyze tables and graphs, going beyond translation to explain the underlying reasons for the obtained results.

- **Comprehensive Final Conclusions:**
  - *Final conclusions should extend beyond summarizing*, presenting a justified answer to the original research question.
  - Indicate potential areas for future research to explore unanswered questions or expand the essay's original scope.

## Criterion D: Presentation
**Strands**: `Structure`, `Layout`

- **Use of Charts, Images, and Tables:**
  - Carefully select and label charts, images, and tables from literature sources.
  - Include large tables of raw data you collected in the appendix, carefully labeled.
  - Design tables of processed data to clearly display relevant information in the most appropriate form.
  - Limit the use of graphs, charts, and tables to enhance the written explanation without overwhelming the communication.

- **Acknowledgment and Referencing:**
  - *Acknowledge and reference any non-original material*, including audio-visual material, text, graphs, and data.
  - Follow proper referencing standards, including the name of the author, date of publication, title of the source, and page numbers.

- **Bibliography, Structure, and Presentation:**
  - Include a bibliography in a standard format.
  - Ensure the title page, table of contents, and page numbers contribute to the overall quality of presentation.
  - Follow accepted academic standards for research paper presentation.
  - Consider using a section and sub-section structure with informative headings.

- **Word Limit and Exclusions:**
  - *Keep the essay narrative within the 4,000-word limit*.
  - Note that graphs, figures, calculations, diagrams, formulas, and equations *are not included in the word count*.
  - *Examiners will not read beyond the 4,000-word limit*, and no assessment will be made on material presented thereafter.

## Criterion E: Engagement
**Strands**: `Reflections on planning and progress`
