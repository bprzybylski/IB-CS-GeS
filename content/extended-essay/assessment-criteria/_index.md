{{< /hint >}}

## Criterion A: Focus and method
**Strands**: `Topic`, `Research question`, `Methodology`

- **Clear Title Focus:**
  - Title should prominently feature the computer science aspect of the research.

- **Avoid ITGS, Broad, and Futuristic Topics:**
  - Ensure your topic aligns with computer science rather than leaning towards social aspects suited for ITGS. 
  - Be cautious of selecting overly broad topics that may lead to a superficial treatment within the word limit.
  - Steer clear of speculative or futuristic topics that often result in opinion-based essays lacking substantial factual support.

- **Sharp and Accessible Research Question:**
  - Ensure a well-focused research question that allows for in-depth exploration within the 4,000-word limit and is suitable for an IB student's understanding. 
  - *Clearly state the research question as a question in the introduction*, providing context for the areas investigated.

- **Justification for Topic:**
  - Explain why the chosen topic and research question are suitable and significant for an Extended Essay. Provide sufficient background information related to the chosen topic.

- **Transparent Methodology:**
  - Clearly describe the methodology to be employed in answering the research question. 
  - Consider incorporating experimental or programming elements with valuable data sources, avoiding reliance on small-scale surveys from fellow students.

- **Well-Planned Essay:**
  - Ensure a well-structured and planned essay that draws from authoritative sources, including internet, literature, and expert interviews.


## Criterion B: Knowledge and understanding
**Strands**: `Context`, `Subject-specific terminology` and `concepts`

- **Demonstrate Personal Understanding:**
  - Showcase your comprehension of the chosen topic, avoiding reliance on reworded source material.
  - Provide clarifications or simplified explanations of technical information, always linking it back to the original research question.

- **Strategic Use of Source Material:**
  - Select and incorporate source material to illustrate the knowledge you gained in relation to the chosen topic.

- **Technical Language Appropriateness:**
  - Employ a technical language suitable for computer science, ensuring clarity that reflects the student's understanding.
  - *Avoid excessive technicality, considering that the reader may not be an expert in the specific addressed topic*.

## Criterion C: Critical thinking
(Strands: Research, Analysis and Discussion and evaluation)

- **Logical Argument Development:**
  - Develop a logically flowing argument throughout the essay through careful planning.

- **Selective and Critical Use of Information:**
  - Select information directly relevant to the research question, avoiding an excessive number of sources.
  - Evaluate the relevance, necessity, and validity of sources, especially those from the internet.

- **Thorough Analysis and Conclusions:**
  - Draw conclusions throughout the essay, not solely in the concluding section.
  - Analyze tables and graphs, going beyond translation to explain the underlying reasons for the obtained results.

- **Comprehensive Final Conclusions:**
  - Final conclusions should extend beyond summarizing, presenting a justified answer to the original research question.
  - Indicate potential areas for future research to explore unanswered questions or expand the essay's original scope.

## Criterion D: Presentation
(Strands: Structure, Layout)
This criterion relates to the extent to which the essay conforms to accepted academic standards in relation
to how research papers should be presented. It also relates to how well these elements support the
reading, understanding and evaluation of the essay.
Students may provide a section and sub-section structure to their essays, with appropriate informative
headings.
Use of charts, images and tables
Any charts, images or tables from literature sources included in the essay must be carefully selected
and labelled. They should only be used if they are directly relevant to the research question, contribute
towards the understanding of the argument and are of a good graphic quality.
8
Large tables of raw data collected by the student are best included in an appendix, where they should be
carefully labelled. Tables of processed data should be designed to clearly display the information in the
most appropriate form. Graphs or charts drawn from the analysed data should be selected to highlight
only the most pertinent aspects related to the argument. Too many graphs, charts and tables will distract
from the overall quality of the communication.
Only processed data that is central to the argument of the essay should be included in the body of the
essay, as close as possible to its first reference. Tables should enhance a written explanation, but not
themselves include significant bodies of text. If they do, then these words must be included in the word
count.
If an experimental method is long and complex, students may place the raw data in an appendix
and include a summary of the methods in the body of the essay. Students who choose this option
must be careful to ensure that the summary contains all elements that contribute to the quality of the
investigation, since appendices are not an essential section of the EE and examiners are not required to
read them. In other words, any important information that contributes to the evaluation of the method
must be in the body of the essay and not the appendix. For experiments where numerical results are
calculated from data obtained by changing one of the variables, it is generally good practice to show one
example of the calculation in the main body of the essay. The remainder can be displayed in tabular or
graphical form.
Any material that is not original must be carefully acknowledged, with specific attention paid to the
acknowledgment and referencing of quotes and ideas. This acknowledgment and referencing is
applicable to audio-visual material, text, graphs and data published in print and electronic sources. If
the referencing does not meet the minimum standard as indicated in the guide (name of author, date of
publication, title of source and page numbers as applicable), and is not consistently applied, work will be
considered as a case of possible academic misconduct.
A bibliography is essential and has to be presented in a standard format. Title page, table of contents,
page numbers, etc must contribute to the quality of presentation.
The essay must not exceed 4,000 words of narrative. Graphs, figures, calculations, diagrams, formulas
and equations are not included in the word count. Students must be aware that examiners will not read
beyond the 4,000-word limit, nor assess any material presented thereafter.

## Criterion E: Engagement
(Strands: Reflections on planning and progress)
This criterion assesses the student’s engagement with their research focus and the research process. It
will be applied by the examiner at the end of the assessment of the essay, after considering the student’s
Reflections on planning and progress Form (RPPF).
9
Students are expected to provide reflections on the decision-making and planning process undertaken
in completing the essay. Students must demonstrate how they arrived at a topic as well as the methods
and approach used. This criterion assesses the extent to which a student has evidenced the rationale for
decisions made throughout the planning process and the skills and understandings developed.
For example, students may reflect on:
• the approach and strategies they chose, and their relative success
• the Approaches to learning skills they have developed and their effect on the student as a learner
• how their conceptual understandings have developed or changed as a result of their research
• setbacks they faced in their research and how they overcame these
• questions that emerged as a result of their research
• what they would do differently if they were to undertake the research again.
Effective reflection highlights the journey the student has engaged in through the EE process. Students
must show evidence of critical and reflective thinking that goes beyond simply describing the procedures
that have been followed.
The reflections must provide the examiner with an insight into student thinking, creativity and originality
within the research process. The student voice must be clearly present and demonstrate the learning that
has taken place.
