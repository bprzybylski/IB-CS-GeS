## Criterion A: Focus and method
(Strands: Topic, Research question, Methodology)
The title should clearly indicate the area of research, with the underlying computer science forming the
principle basis of the essay.
Students should avoid topics that deal primarily with social aspects of information technology that would
lie more within the subject ITGS (eg “The value of friendships attained through social networking sites”).
The research question must be sharply focused in order to allow for significant research into the topic at
an appropriate depth. At the same time the topic must be accessible to an IB student.
Broad topics (eg “To what extent is the variety of different computer languages in existence beneficial or
problematic for programmers”) will only lead to superficial treatment within the 4,000-word limit.
Students should avoid choosing futuristic topics (eg “AI/robots in the next century“), which generally lead
to opinion-based essays that are backed up with few facts. A journalistic approach should also be avoided
as this will tend to lead to a superficial treatment of any computer science.
The research question must be in the form of a question and should be stated in the introduction to the
essay, and the areas investigated must be clearly placed in context. For example, an essay such as “How
useful are neural networks in the evolution of machine learning?” must provide for the reader sufficient
background information into both neural networks and machine learning.
The student must further explain why the topic and research question are worthy choices for an EE.
The methodology candidates will use to answer this question should be clearly described.
The essay must be well planned, making use of a variety of authoritative sources. These can be taken from
the internet, literature and interviews with experts in the relevant field.
Many essays will involve an experimental or programming element, with the resulting data providing a
valuable source. Students should avoid relying on small-scale surveys taken from fellow students.


## Criterion B: Knowledge and understanding
(Strands: Context, Subject-specific terminology and concepts)
The student must demonstrate their own understanding of the topic into which the essay falls.
An essay that is comprised primarily of reworded source material will not provide this evidence. Instead
the student should provide clarifications or simpler explanations of any technical information that is taken
from their sources, always linking this information to the original research question.
The source material should be selected and incorporated in a way that illustrates the knowledge gained
by the student in relation to the chosen topic.
7
The language must be at a technical level that is appropriate to computer science, but used in such a way
that clearly demonstrates the student’s own understanding. Students should beware of making their
essays over-technical and should remember that the reader will not necessarily be an expert in the specific
topic that is being addressed.

## Criterion C: Critical thinking
(Strands: Research, Analysis and Discussion and evaluation)
The development of an argument that flows logically from one section to the next throughout the essay is
only arrived at through sound planning.
The student must carefully select information that is directly relevant to the research question and resist
any temptation to make use of too many sources.
The student needs to evaluate the research material not just in terms of what is relevant and necessary
to support the main argument, but also in terms of the validity of the sources. This particularly applies to
sources taken from the internet.
The student should attempt to draw out conclusions wherever appropriate and not just in the concluding
section of the essay.
Any analysis of tables of results or of graphs should go further than simply translating the results into
words but should look to explain the underlying reasons for the obtained results.
Final conclusions should do more than summarize the essay but should draw the various threads together
in presenting a justified answer to the original research question. The student should indicate where
future research could be undertaken in order to explore unanswered questions or in expanding the
original scope of the essay.

## Criterion D: Presentation
(Strands: Structure, Layout)
This criterion relates to the extent to which the essay conforms to accepted academic standards in relation
to how research papers should be presented. It also relates to how well these elements support the
reading, understanding and evaluation of the essay.
Students may provide a section and sub-section structure to their essays, with appropriate informative
headings.
Use of charts, images and tables
Any charts, images or tables from literature sources included in the essay must be carefully selected
and labelled. They should only be used if they are directly relevant to the research question, contribute
towards the understanding of the argument and are of a good graphic quality.
8
Large tables of raw data collected by the student are best included in an appendix, where they should be
carefully labelled. Tables of processed data should be designed to clearly display the information in the
most appropriate form. Graphs or charts drawn from the analysed data should be selected to highlight
only the most pertinent aspects related to the argument. Too many graphs, charts and tables will distract
from the overall quality of the communication.
Only processed data that is central to the argument of the essay should be included in the body of the
essay, as close as possible to its first reference. Tables should enhance a written explanation, but not
themselves include significant bodies of text. If they do, then these words must be included in the word
count.
If an experimental method is long and complex, students may place the raw data in an appendix
and include a summary of the methods in the body of the essay. Students who choose this option
must be careful to ensure that the summary contains all elements that contribute to the quality of the
investigation, since appendices are not an essential section of the EE and examiners are not required to
read them. In other words, any important information that contributes to the evaluation of the method
must be in the body of the essay and not the appendix. For experiments where numerical results are
calculated from data obtained by changing one of the variables, it is generally good practice to show one
example of the calculation in the main body of the essay. The remainder can be displayed in tabular or
graphical form.
Any material that is not original must be carefully acknowledged, with specific attention paid to the
acknowledgment and referencing of quotes and ideas. This acknowledgment and referencing is
applicable to audio-visual material, text, graphs and data published in print and electronic sources. If
the referencing does not meet the minimum standard as indicated in the guide (name of author, date of
publication, title of source and page numbers as applicable), and is not consistently applied, work will be
considered as a case of possible academic misconduct.
A bibliography is essential and has to be presented in a standard format. Title page, table of contents,
page numbers, etc must contribute to the quality of presentation.
The essay must not exceed 4,000 words of narrative. Graphs, figures, calculations, diagrams, formulas
and equations are not included in the word count. Students must be aware that examiners will not read
beyond the 4,000-word limit, nor assess any material presented thereafter.

## Criterion E: Engagement
(Strands: Reflections on planning and progress)
This criterion assesses the student’s engagement with their research focus and the research process. It
will be applied by the examiner at the end of the assessment of the essay, after considering the student’s
Reflections on planning and progress Form (RPPF).
9
Students are expected to provide reflections on the decision-making and planning process undertaken
in completing the essay. Students must demonstrate how they arrived at a topic as well as the methods
and approach used. This criterion assesses the extent to which a student has evidenced the rationale for
decisions made throughout the planning process and the skills and understandings developed.
For example, students may reflect on:
• the approach and strategies they chose, and their relative success
• the Approaches to learning skills they have developed and their effect on the student as a learner
• how their conceptual understandings have developed or changed as a result of their research
• setbacks they faced in their research and how they overcame these
• questions that emerged as a result of their research
• what they would do differently if they were to undertake the research again.
Effective reflection highlights the journey the student has engaged in through the EE process. Students
must show evidence of critical and reflective thinking that goes beyond simply describing the procedures
that have been followed.
The reflections must provide the examiner with an insight into student thinking, creativity and originality
within the research process. The student voice must be clearly present and demonstrate the learning that
has taken place.
