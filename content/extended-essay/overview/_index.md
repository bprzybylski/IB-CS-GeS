**Note on the sources used**  
The information provided in this and other sections of the Extended Essay is largely derived from two sources: [Paul Baumgarten's website](https://pbaumgarten.com/ib-compsci/extended-essay.md) and the [subject-specific Extended Essay Computer Science guide](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EE-for-CS-guidance-2016.pdf). While I strive to incorporate the most crucial info from these sources and offer additional perspectives, I encourage you to visit these references for a better understanding.

The Extended Essay (EE) in Computer Science (CS) is an independent **research** project where students conduct **experiments** to explore the vast realm of computing and its implications for the world. The work has a maximum length of 4,000 words, with an additional 500 words allocated for reflections, known as the Reflections on Planning and Progress Form (RPPF). (Further details on RPPF can be found [here](https://www.ibo.org/globalassets/new-structure/brochures-and-infographics/pdfs/rppf-completing-en.pdf), and you can refer to the format [here](http://schools.wrdsb.ca/chc/files/2014/05/100-RPPF_e.pdf)).

CS EE is known for its **technical complexity**, and it's relatively uncommon, to the extent that IB doesn't keep statistics on it. However, this isn't meant to discourage you; rather, it emphasizes that this journey is challenging and time-consuming but ultimately rewarding.

The key to a successful CS EE lies in **selecting a good research topic**. But what makes a topic good?

## Choosing a Topic

Here are some criteria to guide you in identifying a strong research topic:

- Ensure your topic is **technical**: Given that Computer Science is a technical course, focus on aspects that delve into the technicalities of the subject. Social issues related to ICT are more suited for the ITGS course.

- Ensure your topic is **specific** and **measurable**: Craft a research question with clear specificity and measurability. Avoid vague inquiries like "Will Windows or Linux give better performance?" Clarify the context, circumstances, and goals to achieve precision. Remember the 4,000-word limit.

- Avoid **speculative** topics: avoid questions about uncertain future developments, such as "Will quantum computing replace normal binary computers?" Analysis of trends and advances is possible, but should demonstrate technical knowledge without relying on speculation.

- Steer clear of **historical** and **ethics/social implications** focus: While historical context or ethical considerations can be included, the primary focus should be on scientific analysis. Avoid turning the essay into a history dissertation; maintain a scientific approach.

- Ensure your topic allows for **primary research**: Conduct original research instead of relying solely on existing statistics or summarizing views. Analyze your findings and consider their implications to fulfill the research requirements.

- Avoid a **computer science project** or software project focus: Save projects like desktop applications or online services for the IA. While data for analysis can be generated from a student-written program, the focus should be on relevant techniques rather than the code's development.

- Ensure your topic is **feasible**: Choose a topic that is manageable with available resources. Avoid investigating complex computing topics for which you lack access to appropriate background material or resources.


To give a better understanding of the differences between good and bad topics look at the table below:

| Good topics | Bad Topics |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| The impact of Kernel Page Table Isolation on<br> performance in intel cpu-powered systems | Factors that affect processor speeds |
| Investigating the algorithmic efficiency of<br>Binary Search Tree and Binary Heap based<br>sorting algorithms | The future of sorting algorithms |
