**Note on the sources used**  
The information provided in this and other sections of the Extended Essay is largely derived from two sources: [Paul Baumgarten's website](https://pbaumgarten.com/ib-compsci/extended-essay.md) and the [subject-specific Extended Essay Computer Science guide](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EE-for-CS-guidance-2016.pdf). While I strive to incorporate the most crucial infro from these sources and offer additional perspectives, I encourage you to visit these references for a more comprehensive understanding.
