# Youtube resources
Some people find video materials more enganging and prefer to learn from them. This page provides a list of worth-considering youtube channels.

## Content overview:
- [The CS classroom](#the-cs-classroom)
- [Computer science](#computer-science)
- [Computerphile](#computerphile)
- [Ben Eater](#ben-eater)
- [CrashCourse/computer science](#crashcoursecomputer-science)
- [freeCodeCamp.org](#freecodecamporg)
- [ArjanCodes](#arjancodes)

## The CS Classroom
**Description:**
[_The CS Classroom_](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCSClassroom/videos) is centered around teaching computer science in general. However, there's a strong emphasis on the IBDP course. All topics and options (besides option B) are covered as comprehensive, long, but easy to follow videos - certainly a cool way to revise the material!

{{< hint danger >}}
The only disadvantage I can think of is that it doesn't cover `Modelling and simulation` option.
{{< /hint >}}

**Example video:**
{{< youtube bmG2cakC4LE >}}

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Web science`, `OOP`

## Computer science
**Description:**
Literally [_Computer science_](https://www.youtube.com/c/ComputerScienceLessons/videos) is focused on explaining theoretical concepts as well as providing some practical tutorials. The topic of each video is very specific, coherent, and cohesive. Furthermore, I believe that the knowledge presented is almost identical to the knowledge required by IB.

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Web science`, `OOP`

## Computerphile
**Description:**
[_Computerphile_](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/videos) is a very well-known and extremely comprehensive channel. Explanation is always clear and undoubtedly facilitates the understanding of a viewer. If there's a big topic, it is broken into easly consumable pieces in form of playlists.

{{< hint danger >}}
However, explanation is so in-depth it may be overwhelming for some people. Also, contary to the previous channel, it doesn't cover one specific concept in one video, but rather the whole topic.

**Example video:**
{{< youtube UvI-AMAtrvE >}}

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Modelling and simulation`, `Web science`, `OOP`


## Ben Eater
**Description:**
[_Ben Eater_](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater) is rather a hardware-oriented channel. The inner working of a computer is covered in full: from electricity, trough bites and processor, to making one's own GPU. Nevertheless, low-level technologies such as assembly and C are also discussed. Admittedly, it is done in respect to the computer (how it interpretes machine code etc.), but still it is.

{{< hint danger >}}
As mentioned, this channel is very hardware-oriented so there's slim to none of e.g. computational thinking. Furthermore, most of the content is so thorough, it is far beyond the scope of IBDP.

**Example video:**
{{< youtube DlEa8kd7n3Q >}}

**Topics:** `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** -

## CrashCourse/computer science
**Description:**
[_CrashCourse_](https://www.youtube.com/c/crashcourse) is a "general-purpose" channel with the variety of courses on different subjects. Of interest here, however, is the **[computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)** playlist. This playlist features brief and coherent videos on computer science. It serves as a good, in-a-nutshell intro to computer science. Besides, the graphics are magnificent!

{{< hint danger >}}
Although the channel may nicely introduce a viewer to a big picture in short time, it does not cover the material in a sufficient way. Thus, this should be facilitated with other resources.
{{< /hint >}}

**Example video:**
{{< youtube DuDz6B4cqVc >}}

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Networks`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Web science`

## freeCodeCamp.org
**Description:**
[_freeCodeCamp.org_](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/videos) focuses on learn-by-yourself content, however, it is useful in the context of IBDP. Explanation of much of the syllabus can be found here. Videos are prepared for both beginners and intermediate (those with prior knowledge).

{{< hint danger >}}
Nonetheless, videos are very extensive and thus may be considered exhausting. Some clips last an hour, two or more. Is is hard to "distill" important information. Also, the quality of certain videos (in terms of the delivery of content) is questionable.
{{< /hint >}}

**Example video:**
{{< youtube byHcYRpMgI4 >}}

**Topics:** `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Modelling and simulation`, `Web science`, `OOP`

## ArjanCodes
**Description:**
[_ArjanCodes_](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArjanCodes) is dedicated to programming and software design. One can find there very useful resources concerning design principles (tips, common mistakes etc.), refactorization, python libraries and much more. This channel may prove particularly crucial while writing IA from CS, especially for design overview, development and extensibility of product.

{{< hint danger >}}
The usefulness of ArjanCodes is limited to IA and programming in general. What's more, code examples are provided only in Python; there's no Java whatsoever.
